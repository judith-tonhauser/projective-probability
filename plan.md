# Projective probability

## Background and motivation
- General hypothesis: The projectivity of some content is not due to conventional specification but rather derived from the conventional meanings of sentences and general principles of rational conversation.
	- Simons et al 2010, Beaver et al 2017: Utterance content projects iff it is not at-issue. (Projectivity Principle)
	- Tonhauser, Beaver & Degen JoS: Utterance content projects to the extent that it is not at-issue. (Gradient Projectivity Principle)
 - To identify whether utterance content is at-issue, we have to identify the Question Under Discussion addressed by the utterance. What, for instance, are factors that influence whether a speaker who utters "Joyce didn't discover that the foundation was cracked" does so with the assumption that the foundation is cracked (i.e., the QUD is whether Joyce discovered it) or with the assumption that there was a discovery but it is not clear what that was discovered (i.e., the QUD is what was discovered). 
 - Previous (experimental) research suggests listeners can rely on prosody to constrain speaker's QUDs of utterances (Cummins & Rohde 2015, Tonhauser 2016, Stevens et al. 2017). 
 - Tonhauser et al ms (Journal of Semantics) showed that projectivity is predicted by at-issueness, the expression that projective content is associated with and world knowledge about the eventuality described by the clause that lexicalizes the projective content. Follow-up work:
 	- Taylor Mahler's QP1 investigates the hypothesis that listeners can rely on contextual cues to the QUD, to identify whether content projects.
	- The project described here investigates the hypothesis that listeners take world knowledge about the prior of eventualities into consideration to identify whether speaker's are committed to the contents of clauses that describe the eventualities. The basic idea is that clauses that describe more highly likely events are more likely to project because they are highly likely than clauses that describe events that are less likely. 
	
- Examples for how prior probabilities come into play with projectivity and at-issueness:
	- Example 1: The interlocutors are looking at a really decrepit house and they know that Sam, a potential homebuyer, visited the house yesterday. The speaker says "Sam didn't discover that the foundation is cracked". The listener knows that the likelihood of the foundation being cracked is high, given the decrepit look of the house. The listener also knows that the speaker knows that the listener will assume that the likelihood of the foundation being cracked is high. In this context, the listener may reason that it is more likely that the speaker is committed to the foundation being cracked, and denying that Sam discovered this, than that the speaker is not committed to the foundation being cracked, and Sam discovering that it is not cracked.
	- Example 2:  The interlocutors are looking at a newly built house and they know that Sam, a potential homebuyer, visited the house yesterday. The speaker says "Sam didn't discover that the foundation is cracked". The listener knows that the likelihood of the foundation being cracked is very low, given that the house is new. The listener also knows that the speaker knows that the listener will assume that the likelihood of the foundation being cracked is low. In this context, the listener may reason that it is more likely that the speaker is not committed to the foundation being cracked, and Sam discovering that it is not cracked than that the speaker is committed to the foundation being cracked, and Sam discovering that it is cracked.
	- Example 3: As in Example 1, but now Sam is a home inspector. If the speaker says "Sam didn't discover that the foundation is cracked", the listener will be less likely to assume that the speaker is committed to the foundation being cracked because an expert evaluated the house and it is more likely that the foundation is not cracked and Sam therefore discovered that it is not cracked, than that the foundation is cracked and Sam not discovering it.

## Research hypothesis

Our goal in this project is to investigate the hypothesis that the projectivity of clausal content is influenced by the prior probability of the event described by the clause that conveys the content: higher probability of the event results in higher projectivity of the content. To investigate the hypothesis, we manipulate the prior probability of events described by clauses and investigate the projectivity of the content of those clauses.  

The projective content that we use to investigate the hypothesis is the content of clausal complements of attitude predicates: we hypothesize that a higher prior probability of the events described by those clauses results in higher projectivity of the content of those clauses. Since the extent to which the content of the clausal complement of the attitude predicate is entailed content may influence projectivity, we also control for the extent to which the content of the complement is entailed. We will thereby also be able to identify how the extent to which the complement is entailed interacts with the effect of prior probability on projectivity.

## Prior and posterior probability of eventualities

- Eventualities are described by sentences like "Mary is pregnant".
- Interlocutors in a discourse have prior probability (belief) distributions over eventualities: e.g., the prior probability of the eventuality described by "Mary is pregnant" is an interlocutor's subjective belief that this state holds (at the topic time) before considering some evidence (e.g., hearing a sentence that describes the eventuality). 
- The prior probability (or: prior) of an eventuality depends on world knowledge: e.g., the state of Mary being pregnant is lower if Mary is an 8-year old girl (and the interlocutor whose prior we are concerned with is aware of this) than if Mary is a 25-year old woman (and the interlocutor whose prior we are concerned with is aware of this).
- In this experiment, we control the prior of eventualities by presenting information about the world, in the form of 'facts': e.g., given Fact 1, the state of Mary being pregnant has a higher probability than given Fact 2. 
	
	- Fact 1: Mary just walked into an OBGYN's office.
	
	- Fact 2: Mary is a 6-year old girl.
	
- In this experiment, we are interested in the posterior probability distribution that listeners (the relevant interlocutors) have for eventualities after taking into account the relevant evidence, which are i) facts about the world, and ii) the speaker's choice of attitude predicate in their utterance of a complex sentence that embeds a clause that describes the eventuality.
- The uttered sentences are polar questions in which an attitude predicate (with a third person subject) embeds a clause that describes the relevant eventuality. The attitude predicates differ on two dimensions: i) the extent to which the content of the clausal complement is entailed, and ii) the extent to which the content of the clausal complement is projective. These two dimensions are not independent: more projective complements are also more likely to be entailed.
- Thus, more specifically, we hypothesize that, in our main (projectivity) experiment, the extent to which listeners take speakers to be committed about the relevant content (i.e., the probability which they take the speakers to have for the eventuality described by the content) depends on i) facts about the world, and ii) the attitude predicates of the uttered sentences. 

## Background on entailment

- Entailment is a relationship between two sentences, or between a sentence and a proposition: sentence A entails sentence/proposition B iff every situation in which A is true is a situation in which B is true. In other words, "entailment" is defined as a context-independent, binary, categorical relationship (and we do not intend to change that).
- However, for some attitude predicates, remarks have been made to the extent that the content of the clausal complement may be felt to follow from unembedded sentences in many though not all contexts. Schlenker (2010:139) about "announce": "in some contexts, it does not entail the truth of its complement; in other contexts, it entails and presupposes the truth of its complement.". For instance, he suggested that whether the content of the complement of "announce" is judged to be entailed depends on who the attitude holder is; e.g., "Mary announced that she is pregnant" seems to be judged to entail that Mary is pregnant if Mary is a sane, adult woman but not if Mary is 8 years old.
- Anand & Hacquard 2014 suggest that there are predicates that at first glance seem veridical (i.e., entail the content of the complement), but really are not, on closer inspection. Similarly, Swanson (2012) didn't take the content of the complement of "establish" to be entailed though other speakers might argue that "€œThe detective established that Margret didn't kill James" entails that Margret didn't kill James.
- Haven't worked through this: Sudo (2012): Ph.D. thesis supposedly argued that some triggers don't entail the presupposition.
- So, for semanticists, finding one situation in which the content of the clausal complement does not follow from an unembedded sentence with an attitude predicate or realizing that one can say "a falsely predicate p" (which implies that p is not true) is sufficient to say that the predicate does not entail the content of the complement.
- For naive language users, however, predicates may differ in the extent to which the content of the clausal complement is taken to follow from unembedded sentences with the predicate. We take "veridicality" to be a possibly gradient notion and define it as the extent to which the content of the clausal complement follows from unembedded sentences with the predicate. Exploring the veridicality of different attitude predicates is an interesting project of its own: 
	- Is veridicality a gradient property? 
	- Are predicates that entail the content of the clausal complement highly veridical? 
- Some authors assume that only entailed meanings are presuppositions: non-entailed meanings that speakers are taken to be committed to are considered a completely different phenomenon (e.g., Anand & Hacquard 2014: "illusion of factivity" and "illusion of projection"). 
- In our experiments, we explore whether the extent to which the projectivity of the complement is influenced by the prior of the eventuality described by the complement differs with the extent to which the clausal complement veridical (i.e., we ask: is there an interaction between prior probability and veridicality?).

## Three separate experiments
1. prior probability
2. veridicality 
3. projectivity

## Prior probability experiment

- Goal: to identify readers' prior probabilities of the eventualities described by main clauses, given a fact about the world
- The eventualities should be non-gradable and non-subjective, in order to avoid variability in judgments that are due to uncertainty about thresholds or about what counts as X for the speaker.
- For each eventuality, we identify its prior given one of 2 facts about the world: one fact in which the eventuality has a higher prior probability, though not at ceiling, and one in which the eventuality has a lower prior probability, though not at floor. 
- We need to avoid eventualities being too likely or too unlikely, given their two facts, because a) if they are too likely, then people might argue that the facts of the world entail the content of the clause describing the eventuality, and b) if they are too unlikely, then participants might give wonky projectivity ratings.
- We have chosen facts that either describe permanent properties of individuals (e.g., being German) or at least not punctual ones (e.g., taking a prenatal yoga class) rather than punctual ones (e.g., just walked into Planned Parenthood).
- Response task: Participants assess the likeliness of the eventuality described by a main clause, given a fact about the world
	- Fact: Mary is taking a prenatal yoga class.
	  
	  How likely is it that Mary is pregnant?
- Response on slider from 0/very unlikely to 1/very likely
- Materials: 20 atomic main clauses that lexicalize the eventualities, presented with one of two facts each, i.e., 40 stimuli total
- Each participant rates the likeliness of 20 unique eventualities, given a fact about the world.
- We want at least 20 ratings per eventuality/fact combination.
- Analysis: For each eventuality, we calculate the mean likeliness, which we take to be the mean prior probability: the higher the mean likeliness, the higher the prior probability of the eventuality. In the projectivity experiment, we use those eventualities for which the two facts result in a relatively high (though not at ceiling) prior and a relatively low (though not at floor) prior.

## Veridicality experiment

- Goal: to identify the extent to which the content of the clausal complement follows from an unembedded sentence with an attitude predicate. 
- The clausal complements are the 20 clauses for which we established facts in the prior probability experiment that result in the eventualities described by these clauses to have a higher versus a lower prior.
- The attitude predicates are categorized by their veridicality and the projectivity of the content of their complement. Our goal (for now) is to include 20 attitude predicates of which roughly half entail the content of the complement (i.e., are highly veridical) and roughly half are of low or lower veridicality. The predicates are also such that the content of the clausal complement of roughly half is projective and of roughly half is not projective. (Not all four possible combinations are equally represented however.) A difficulty in establishing which predicates fall into which group is that projectivity and veridicality have not been empirically tested for many of them.
- Response task: Given the standard definition of entailment (see above), we need a task that probes the extent to which the attitude sentence can be true and the content of the clausal complement false, i.e., the extent to which the truth of the content of the clausal complement follows from the attitude sentence. 
- Contradiction task: 
	
	Bill: Steve believes/announced/discovered/knows that Marge is pregnant, but I know that she isn't. 
	
	Does Bill sound like he is contradicting himself?
- Response on slider from 0/no to 1/yes
- Materials: atomic sentences with 20 attitude predicates, 20 clausal complements per predicate 
	
	==> 400 stimuli total 
- Each participant sees each attitude predicate with a unique clausal complement. If we want 10 ratings per combination, we need 4,000 ratings total. 
- For each predicate, we calculate the mean contradiction rating, which we take to be the mean veridicality rating of the predicate: the higher the mean contradiction rating, the more veridical the predicate is.
- Results: We expect to find that predicates that entail their clausal complement are highly veridical and that veridicality is a gradient property. As a consequence, predicates that do not entail their clausal complement may differ in how veridical they are. Predicates that are more highly veridical may be more highly projective.
- Assumption: Predicates that entail the content of the complement have very high veridicality ratings, and predicates that entail the content of the complement have a range of veridicality ratings. Contradictoriness can therefore be used to make claims both about entailment (a binary property) and about veridicality (a gradient property).

## Projectivity experiment

- Goal: to identify the extent to which participants take the speaker to be committed to the content of the clausal complement of an attitude predicate realized in a polar question, given a fact about the world.
- Response task: Participants are told that speaker knows $fact$, thereby also conveying to **the participant** that the fact is true. 
	- "certain that" diagnostic (from Journal of Semantics paper)
		- Bill knows that Mary just walked into Planned Parenthood.
	  	- Bill: Did Sue discover that Mary is pregnant?
		- Is Bill certain that Mary is pregnant?
- Response on a slider from 0/no to 1/yes
- Materials: 20 polar questions formed from sentences with attitude predicates that embed a clausal complement, given a fact

==> 800 stimuli (20 predicates x 20 complements x 2 facts)

==> 16,000 judgments = 800 stimuli x 20 judgments per combination

- Each participant rates the extent to which the speaker is certain of the content of the clausal complement. We assume that the extent to which the speaker is taken to be certain about the content is the extent to which the content projects (as in prior research).

## Linear mixed-effects model we want to fit

	projectivity ~ prior * veridicality + (1 + prior * veridicality | participant) + (1 + prior | predicate) + (1 + veridicality | fact)

where
- projectivity: individual participants' projectivity ratings, of a clause that describes an eventuality, given a fact 
- prior: mean prior probability rating of the eventuality given a fact
- veridicality: mean veridicality rating of the predicate

Sample CSV file in long format:

| Participant  | Eventuality  | Fact  | Prior of eventuality given fact | Veridicality of predicate | Projectivity rating given fact  |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|  1 | ev1 | fact1 | 0.8 | 0.9 | 0.7 |
|  1 | ev1 | fact2 | 0.2 | 0.9 | 0.5 |


Motivation for including interaction term: We hypothesize that projectivity is predicted by the prior. According to classical analyses of presuppositions, non-entailed complements do not project, they at best give the "illusion of projection". We, however, hypothesize that the projectivity of non-entailed complements will be influenced by the prior, too. We include the interaction term because we hypothesize that for less veridical predicates the predicate itself exerts less control over whether the speaker is taken to be committed to the content of the complement than for more strongly veridical predicates. 

Motivation for random effects:
- (1 + prior * veridicality | participant) -- to account for individual participant noise in overall ratings and in individual participant noise in fixed effects of interest
- (1 +  prior | predicate) -- to account for individual predicate noise in overall ratings and in individual predicate noise in prior effect
- (1 + veridicality | fact) -- to account for individual fact noise in overall ratings and in individual fact noise in effect of veridicality **[JD asks: is this doppelt gemoppelt with previous random effect?]**

[Perhaps also include as fixed or random effects: tense of attitude predicate?]
[Perhaps also include as fixed effect: length of complement in number of words]

## Results and discussion

- We expect to find:
	- significant main effect of "prior": complement clauses that describe eventualities with a higher prior are more highly projective than complement clauses that describe eventualities with a lower prior
	- significant main effect of "veridicality": complement clauses of more veridical predicates are more highly projective than complement clauses of less veridical predicates
	- significant interaction: the effect of the prior is stronger with less veridical predicates than with more veridical predicates

- Given these findings, we can argue:
	- To identify speaker commitment, listeners take into consideration the prior of the eventuality: either how likely they take the eventuality to be, or how likely the speaker is to take the eventuality to be. At this point, we cannot tell the difference because we are not distinguishing between the listeners'/participants' epistemic state and properties and the speaker's epistemic state and properties. In future research, it would be good to explore how speaker commitment interacts with differences between what the listener believes about the world and what the speaker believes about the world. E.g., speaker (who is known to be a white Southener) says "Did Bill discover that Trump is making America great again?", and participant is black man from New York. 
	- Theoretical models of projectivity need to incorporate these priors.
	- Speakers may be taken to be committed to a particular content, even if that content is not entailed content. This raises the question of whether entailed and non-entailed projective content should receive distinct analyses. We argue that not. 

## Stimuli
	
**20 predicates**

Explanation for table:
- Projectivity column: 
	- "yes":  predicate is generally taken to be factive or we have evidence that it is
	- "no": predicate is generally taken to be non-factive or we have evidence that it is
	- "yes?": evidence is shaky but the complement may be projective
	- "no?": evidence is shaky but the complement doesn't look projective
- Veridicality column:
	- "yes": complement is entailed
	- "no": complement is not entailed and veridicality is low
	- "no?": complement is not entailed but veridicality is high **[some of these are just guesses; we don't have data]**

20 predicates currently in table (from top to bottom):
- 5 predicates that are projective and veridical (yes/yes)
- 1 predicate ("establish") that is probably projective and veridical (yes?/yes)
- 3 predicates that are not projective and not veridical (no/no)
- 3 predicates that are probably not projective and probably not veridical (no(?)/no(?))
- 7 predicates that are (probably) projective and (probably) not veridical (yes(?)/no(?))
- 1 predicate that is (probably) not projective but veridical (no/yes)

## 20 (non-gradable, non-subjective) eventualities (described by main or embedded clauses) and two facts about the world each

The facts are non-punctual eventualities so that knowing them (projectivity experiment) is not implausible.

**10 women's names / 10 men's names**

Stimuli naming: e.g., 1H (event 1 with fact that gives high prior), 1L (event 1 with fact that gives low prior)

1. Mary is pregnant (Mary is a middle school student / Mary is taking a prenatal yoga class)
2. Josie went on vacation to France (Josie doesn't have a passport / Josie loves France)
3. Emma studied on Saturday morning (Emma is in first grade / Emma is in law school)
4. Olivia sleeps until noon (Olivia has two small children / Olivia works the third shift)
5. Sophia got a tattoo (Sophia is a high end fashion model / Sophia is a hipster)
6. Mia drank 2 cocktails last night (Mia is a nun / Mia is a college student)
7. Isabella ate a steak on Sunday (Isabella is a vegetarian / Isabella is from Argentina)
8. Emily bought a car yesterday (Emily never has any money / Emily has been saving for a year)
9. Grace visited her sister (Grace hates her sister / Grace loves her sister)
10. Zoe calculated the tip (Zoe is 5 years old / Zoe is a math major)
11. Danny ate the last cupcake (Danny is a diabetic / Danny loves cake)
12. Frank got a cat (Frank is allergic to cats / Frank has always wanted a pet)
13. Jackson ran 10 miles (Jackson is obese / Jackson is training for a marathon)
14. Jayden rented a car (Jayden doesn't have a driver's license / Jayden's car is in the shop)
15. Tony had a drink last night (Tony has been sober for 20 years / Tony really likes to party with his friends)

19. Jon walks to work (Jon lives 10 miles away from work / Jon lives 2 blocks away from work)
20. Charley speaks Spanish (Charley lives in Korea / Charley lives in Mexico)

Fillers, to assess whether participants are paying attention:  
F1. Barry lives in Europe (Fact: Barry lives in Germany)  
F2. Tammy speaks Italian and Greek (Fact: Tammy is a rabbit)  

Evaluation after running prior pilot with 10 participants on a Friday evening:
- The two fillers seem to work well, responses at ceiling for F1 and at floor for F2 for 8 of the 10 participants. 1 participant gave middling responses for both (not paying attention?), 1 participant gave floor responses for F1 (not paying attention?). No changes to fillers.
- For all stimuli, except #3, the H and L facts produced responses where the H was higher than the L. For stimulus #3, the H and L responses were close together (H: 0.43, L: 0.42; Emma gained a pound last week (Emma is on a very strict diet / Emma is a toddler)). I changed this stimulus to the one listed above. Since 4H was also decidedly lower than other H stimuli (0.34; Olivia sleeps until noon (H: Olivia is a bar tender)), I also changed that one.
- One Turker commented that 35 cents would be enough payment (we paid 55 cents), but the mean completion time was 5.44 minutes and the median completion time was 4.20 minutes, so I left the 55 cents payment (for a 4 minute-long experiment).
