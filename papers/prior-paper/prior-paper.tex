\begin{abstract}

Interpreters' beliefs about the world have been shown to influence utterance processing and interpretation in a variety of empirical domains. This paper reports three experiments designed to investigate the hypothesis that such beliefs influence projection, that is, inferences about speaker commitment to non-entailed utterance content. We find, in support of the hypothesis, that the higher the prior probability of content, the more projective it is. We also find that projection is influenced by the average beliefs of a group and at the by-participant level. \jt{(Word count: xxx words)}

\section{Introduction}

Interpreters' beliefs about the world have been shown to influence sentence processing (e.g., \citealt*{chambers-etal02,hagoort-etal2004,hald-etal2007}) and utterance interpretation in a variety of empirical domains, including ambiguity resolution (e.g., \citealt*{chambers-etal04,bicknell-rohde2009}), reference resolution (e.g., \citealt{hanna-tanenhaus04}), genericity (e.g., \citealt{tessler-goodman2019}) and scalar implicature (e.g., \citealt*{degen-etal2015}).\footnote{Different kinds of beliefs have been investigated. Some of these are called world knowledge, but it's not clear that it's knowledge. We use the more cautious term belief.} 


This paper provides empirical evidence that American English interpreters' beliefs also influence projection. Projection is characterized as the speaker being committed to content, based on their utterance, which then also influences whether the listener is committed: the content becomes part of the common ground between the speaker and the listener. A speaker who utters the polar question in (\ref{pq}) may be committed to the truth of the content of the complement, that it is raining, even though it is realized in a polar question, that is, even though it is not entailed content.

The hypothesis that the prior probability of content influences its projection has been put forth in \citealt*{stevens-etal2017} and \citealt*{tbd-variability}. \citealt{stevens-etal2017} investigated the projection of the prejacent of manner adverb sentences; for instance, the content that Masha ran of the negated sentence {\em Masha didn't run quickly}. They hypothesized that the observed by-item variability might be due to prejacents differing in their prior probability and higher prior probability contents being more projective. \citealt{tbd-variability} investigated the projection of content associated with 19 American English expressions, including the content of the complement of clause-embedding predicates like {\em know}, illustrated in (\ref{know}), and the prejacent of {\em stop}; for instance, the content that Mary's daughter has been biting her nails of the polar question {\em Has Mary's daughter stopped biting her nails?}. These authors, too, hypothesized that prior probability influences projection (p.500), as formulated in the hypothesis in (\ref{hyp}):

%Like \citealt{stevens-etal2017}, \citealt[500]{tbd-variability} hypothesized that ``the projectivity of content may depend on the prior probability of the event described by the expression that conveys the content, such that content conveyed by expressions that describe more a priori likely events may be more likely to project''.

%investigated the projection of the prejacent of utterances of manner adverb sentences, illustrated in (\ref{manner}). An utterance of (\ref{manner}a) implies both the prejacent, that Masha ran, and that her running was done in a quick manner. The prejacent is projective because it may also be implied by an utterance of the negated variant of (\ref{manner}a) given in (\ref{manner}b), especially when the adverb is produced with prosodic emphasis.

%\end{xlist}
%\end{exe}
%\citealt{stevens-etal2017} observed by-item variability in the projection of the prejacent and suggested that this variability may be due to interpreters having different prior probabilities about the prejacent.

\begin{exe}
\ex\label{hyp} {\bf Hypothesis:} The higher the prior probability of content, the more projective the content.
\end{exe}

One piece of evidence for the hypothesis in (\ref{hyp}) comes from \citet{mahler2020}, who investigated the projection of politically charged content, which was conveyed by the complement of two classes of English clause-embedding predicates, namely factive predicates (represented by {\em know, discover, realize, see}) and non-factive predicates (represented by {\em believe, think, feel}). For example, the politically charged content in (\ref{mahler-stim}) is that Obama improved/damaged the American economy, which is conveyed by the complement of {\em know}, which is embedded under negation. The prior probability of the content was manipulated by the speaker (Cindy in (\ref{mahler-stim})) speaking at the club meeting of either the College Republicans or Democrats.

\begin{exe}
\ex\label{mahler-stim} Cindy, at the College Republicans/Democrats club meeting: \\ Ben doesn't know that\ldots
\begin{xlist}
\ex \ldots Obama improved the American economy.
\ex \ldots Obama damaged the American economy. \hfill (\citealt[784f.]{mahler2020})
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
Consistent with the hypothesis in (\ref{hyp}), \citet{mahler2020} found that higher prior probability content (e.g., a liberal content like (\ref{mahler-stim}a) uttered by a Democrat speaker) was more projective than a lower prior probability content (e.g., a liberal content uttered by a Republican speaker). The effect was observed for both classes of predicates.

In contrast to \citealt{mahler2020}, \citealt{lorson2018} did not find empirical support for the hypothesis in (\ref{hyp}). \citet{lorson2018} investigated the influence of prior probability on the projection of the pre-state content of the English change of state verb {\em stop}. Prior probability was manipulated through gender stereotypes reported in \citealt*{boyce-etal2018}. For instance, because men are more likely than women to be plumbers, the pre-state content of (\ref{lorson-stim}a), that James has worked as a plumber, was hypothesized to be more projective than the pre-state content of (\ref{lorson-stim}b), that Linda has worked as a plumber.

\begin{exe}
\ex\label{lorson-stim} 
\begin{xlist}
\ex Did James stop working as a plumber?
\ex Did Linda stop working as a plumber? \hfill (\citealt[38]{lorson2018})
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

Several differences between \citeposs{mahler2020} and \citeposs{lorson2018} investigations could be implicated in the differential support for the hypothesis in (\ref{hyp}): a) the projective content investigated (contents of clausal complements vs.\ pre-state content of {\em stop}), b) the entailment-canceling environment (negation vs.\ polar question), c) the manipulation of the prior probability (political party affiliation vs.\ gender stereotypes), and d) how explicitly the prior-manipulating information was provided to the participants (statement of political party affiliation vs.\  use of a male or female name to indicate gender). The three experiments we report on in this paper investigate the hypothesis in (\ref{hyp}) on the basis of the projection of the contents of complements of clause-embedding predicates that are embedded in polar questions. In contrast to \citealt{mahler2020}, our experiments include 20 clause-embedding predicates (rather than just 7) and we do not assume a factivity classification of the predicates because \citealt{tonhauser-degen-factive} did not find empirical support for a class of factive predicates. Our experiments manipulate the prior probability of these contents in a broad variety of ways and the prior manipulating information is provided to participants explicitly.

Both \citealt{mahler2020} and \citealt{lorson2018} measured projection using the `certain that' diagnostic (see, e.g., \citealt{tonhauser-salt26,tbd-variability,demarneffe-etal-sub23}): Participants were asked whether the speaker is certain of the relevant content and they responded on a sliding scale, where one end was labeled negatively and the other positively. Both investigations assumed that the more positive the response, the more projective the content. Our experiments also used the `certain that' diagnostic with such a sliding scale. Exp.~1 (section \ref{s2}) investigated the hypothesis in (\ref{hyp}) by measuring both prior probability and projection from each participant. This within-participant design allows us to investigate whether the hypothesis in (\ref{hyp}) holds at the by-participant level. In Exps.~2 (section \ref{s3}), prior probability and projection were measured from separate groups, as in \citealt{mahler2020} and \citealt{lorson2018}. We find support for the hypothesis that prior probability influences projection in both Exps.~1 and 2. The paper offers concluding remarks in section \ref{s4}. 

%\jt{The two investigations also differed in how prior probability was included in the model: In \citealt{mahler2020}, both political party and political orientation of the content were entered as binary categorical factors, whereas the consistency measure in \citealt{lorson2018} was a linear predictor.}

%Lorson, p.36: ``The consistency measure is a value that ranges from 0 to 1, where a value close to 0 means that the gender of an individual is inconsistent with a certain occupation, according to the collected gender-bias that was found to be associated with that occupation. A value close to 1 means that the gender of an individual is consistent with an occupation.''

\section{Experiment 1}\label{s2}

This experiment investigated the hypothesis that the prior probability of content influences its projection, specifically, that the higher the prior probability of content is, the more projective it is. Prior probability and projection ratings were collected for the contents of 20 clauses that realized the complements of clause-embedding predicates.\footnote{\label{f-github}The experiments, data and R code for generating the figures and analyses of the experiments reported on in this paper are available at [redacted for review]. Exp.~1 was pregistered: [link removed for review]. Exps.~1 and 2 were conducted with approval from the IRB of [university redacted] and informed consent was obtained.}

\paragraph{Participants} 300 participants with U.S.\ IP addresses and at least 99\% of previous HITs approved were recruited on Amazon's Mechanical Turk platform (ages: 18-82, median: 35.5; 119 female, 179 male, 1 other, 1 undeclared). They were paid \$1.80.

\paragraph{Materials} The prior probability and the projection of the contents of 20 clauses were measured. As shown for the sample clause in (\ref{sample-clause}), each clause was paired with two facts. One fact was hypothesized to result in higher prior probability ratings for the content  and the other in a lower prior probability rating. See Supplement \ref{a-stim} for the full set of clauses and facts. 

\begin{exe}
\ex\label{sample-clause} Sample clause: Julian dances salsa.
\\ Higher probability fact: Julian is Cuban.
\\ Lower probability fact: Julian is German.
\end{exe}

Prior probability and projection were measured in separate blocks. In the prior block, the 20 clauses were realized as the complements of {\em How likely is it that\ldots?}~questions. As shown in (\ref{target}), each target stimulus consisted of one of the two facts for that clause and the {\em How likely is it that\ldots?} question. There were a total of 40 target stimuli in the prior block.

\begin{exe}
\ex\label{target}  Sample target stimuli in the prior block
\begin{xlist}
\ex {\bf Fact:} Julian is Cuban. \\ How likely is it that Julian dances salsa?
\ex {\bf Fact:} Julian is German.  \\ How likely is it that Julian dances salsa?
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

In the projection block, the target stimuli consisted of a fact and a polar question that was uttered by a named speaker, as shown in (\ref{stim}). The fact was one of the two facts that the clause was paired with. The polar questions were formed by realizing the 20 clauses as the complements of the 20 clause-embedding predicates in (\ref{preds}).  There were a total of 800 target stimuli in the projection block.

\begin{exe}
\ex\label{stim} Sample target stimuli in the projection block
\begin{xlist}
\ex {\bf Fact (which Carol knows):} Julian is Cuban.  \\ 
{\bf Carol:} Does Sandra know that Julian dances salsa?

\ex {\bf Fact (which Carol knows):} Julian is German.  \\ 
{\bf Carol:} Does Sandra know that Julian dances salsa?
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

\begin{exe}
\ex\label{preds} 20 clause-embedding predicates 

{\em be annoyed, discover, know, reveal, see, acknowledge, admit, announce, confess, confirm, establish, hear, inform, prove, pretend, suggest, say, think, be right, demonstrate}
\end{exe}
The 20 predicates in (\ref{preds}) include a cross-section of English clause-embedding predicates: They include cognitive predicates (e.g., {\em know}), emotive predicates (e.g., {\em be annoyed}), communication predicates (e.g., {\em announce}), and inferential predicates (e.g., {\em prove}), as well as so-called factive and non-factive predicates (e.g., {\em know} vs.\ {\em think}); as mentioned above, \citealt{tonhauser-degen-factive} challenge this latter classification.

The projection block also included 6 control stimuli, which were used to assess participants' attention to the task. The content of these control stimuli was hypothesized to not project. For example, in the control stimulus in (\ref{control}), the speaker is not committed to the main clause content, that Zack is coming to the meeting tomorrow. The control stimuli were presented with a fact that we hypothesized to not influence the prior probability of the content. The same 6 main clauses were also used to form the 6 filler stimuli in the prior block, but these were not used to assess participants' attention to the task. In each block, the same 6 control stimuli were presented to all participants. For the full set of stimuli Supplement \ref{a-stim}.

\begin{exe}
\ex\label{control} Sample control stimulus in the projection block \\ {\bf Fact (which Margaret knows):}  Zack is a member of the golf club. \\ {\bf Margaret:} Is Zack coming to the meeting tomorrow?
\end{exe}

%\begin{exe}
%\ex\label{control-prior} Sample filler stimulus in the prior block \\ {\bf Fact:}  Zack is a member of the golf club. \\ How likely is it that Zack is coming to the meeting tomorrow?
%\end{exe}

For each participant, a set consisting of the 20 clauses with one of their facts was randomly generated, with 10 higher and 10 lower probability facts, for a total of 20 clause/fact combinations. Participants saw a total of 52 stimuli: 20 target stimuli in each block, 6 control stimuli in the projection block and 6 filler stimuli in the prior block. In the prior block, participants rated the prior probability of the contents of these 20 clauses given the facts. In the projection block, the 20 clauses were randomly realized as the complements of the 20 clause-embedding predicates. Here, participants rated the projection of the contents of the 20 clauses given the facts. Block order and within-block trial order were randomized.

\paragraph{Procedure} In the projection block, participants were told to imagine that they are at a party and that, on walking into the kitchen, they overhear somebody ask somebody else a question. Participants were asked to rate whether the speaker was certain of the content of the complement, taking into consideration the fact that was presented. They gave their responses on a slider marked `no' at one end (coded as 0) and `yes' at the other (coded as 1), as shown in Figure \ref{fig-exp1-projection}. In the prior block, participants were told to read facts and to assess the likelihood of events, given those facts. They gave their responses on a slider marked `impossible' at one end (coded as 0) and `definitely' at the other (coded as 1), as shown in the sample trial in Figure \ref{f-exp1-prior}

After completing the experiment, participants filled out a short, optional survey about their age, their gender, their native language(s) and, if English is their native language, whether they are a speaker of American English (as opposed to, e.g., Australian or Indian English). To encourage them to respond truthfully, participants were told that they would be paid no matter what answers they gave in the survey.

\paragraph{Data exclusion} We excluded data based on self-declared non-native speaker status and other criteria given in Supplement \ref{a-exclusion}, leaving data from 286 participants to be analyzed (ages 18-82; median: 35.5; 116 female, 186 male, 1 other, 1 undeclared).

\subsection{Results}

The manipulation of the prior probability of the 20 contents was successful. Figure \ref{f-prior} plots the mean prior probabilities of the 20 contents by fact (participants' ratings are given as light dots). The mean prior probability rating for each content was higher when the content was presented with the higher probability fact than when it was presented with the lower probability fact.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.75\paperwidth]{../../results/9-prior-projection/graphs/prior-ratings}

\caption{Mean prior probability by content and fact in Exp.~1. Error bars indicate 95\% bootstrapped confidence intervals. Light dots indicate participants' ratings.} 
\label{f-prior}
\end{figure}

To address the question of whether prior probability influences projection, Figure \ref{f-projection-mean} plots the mean certainty ratings for the contents of the clausal complements by clause-embedding predicate and by fact, as well as the mean certainty rating for the main clause content (abbreviated `MC'). As shown, the mean certainty ratings were higher for contents  presented with the higher probability facts than for contents presented with the lower probability fact. This result, which holds for all 20 clause-embedding predicates, suggests that prior probability influences projection.

\caption{Mean certainty ratings by predicate and prior probability of the content of the complement in Exp.~1. Error bars indicate 95\% bootstrapped confidence intervals. Light dots indicate participants' ratings.} 
\label{f-projection-mean}
\end{figure}
\jt{We also replicate \citepos{tonhauser-degen-factive} result that there is by-predicate variation in the projection of the content of the complement: for instance, the content of the complement of {\em be annoyed} is more projective than that of {\em discover}, which in turn is more projective than that of {\em announce}. The Spearman rank correlation between the mean certainty ratings in Exp.~1 (collapsing over facts) and \citepos{tonhauser-degen-factive} Exp.~1a is .991; see Supplement \ref{a-comparison} for a visualization. Exp.~1 thereby provides further evidence for the systematic influence of the predicate on projection.}

Figure \ref{f-prior} revealed by-participant variation in prior probability ratings, which means that participants' prior probability ratings need not align with the prior probability classification assumed in Figure \ref{f-projection-mean}. For example, given a particular content (e.g., that Julian dances salsa), it is possible that one participant's prior probability rating was lower than that of another participant, even though the first participant was presented with the higher probability fact (Julian is Cuban) and the second one with the lower probability fact (Julian is German). To investigate whether prior probability influences projection at the by-participant level, Figure \ref{f-projection} plots the participants' certainty ratings by their prior probability ratings. (The color coding here merely represents the type of fact the participant was presented with. No classification is imposed.) The linear smoothers suggest a positive correlation for each predicate between prior probability and certainty ratings such that contents with higher prior probability ratings receive higher certainty ratings. This result suggests that prior probability influences projection even at the by-participant level.

\end{figure}

\newpage

The qualitative observations about the relations between prior probability, clause-embedding predicate and projection were borne out statistically. We fitted a Bayesian mixed effects Beta regression model  with weakly informative priors using the \verb|brms| \citep{buerkner2017}  package in R \citep{R} on the target data (5,720 data points). The model predicted the certainty ratings from a fixed effect of prior probability and included the maximal random effects structure justified by the design, namely random by-participant and by-item intercepts (where an item is a combination of a predicate and a complement clause). A Beta regression model estimates the mean of the outcome distribution (like a linear regression model).\footnote{Beta regression models also estimate a second parameter, namely the precision, which is a measure of dispersion: the greater the precision, the more concentrated the ratings are around the mean. In this paper, we rely on the estimated mean to identify whether prior probability predicts projection. Both the estimated mean and precision are reported in the full model output table in Supplement \ref{modeldetails}.} We thus obtain a 95\% credible interval for \jt{the mean effect of prior probability on certainty?}. Supplement \ref{modeldetails} motivates the use of Beta regression over linear regression, provides a brief primer on how to interpret Bayesian mixed effects Beta regression models, and reports the full model output.

\jt{We need to report two models here: predicting projection from prior at by-participant level, but also predicting mean projection from mean prior, to allow for comparison to Exps.~2}

\subsection{Discussion}

The results of Exp.~1 provide empirical support for the hypothesis, advanced in \citealt{stevens-etal2017} and \citealt{tbd-variability}, that the higher the prior probability of content, the more projective it is. 

These results confirm \citepos{mahler2020} results and expand on them in several ways. First, while \citealt{mahler2020} manipulated only the political party affiliation of the speaker, the manipulation in Exp.~1 relied on 20 distinct properties of the individuals denoted by the subjects of the 20 clauses (e.g., whether Julian is more likely to dance salsa, depending on whether he is German or Cuban, or whether Zoe is more likely to have calculated the tip, depending on whether she is 5 years old or a math major). Thus, the result of Exp.~1 suggest a general effect of prior probability on projection.\footnote{None of the prior probability manipulations in Exp.~1 relied on gender stereotypes as we only became aware of \citealt{lorson2018} after running Exp.~1. We hypothesize that \citeposs{lorson2018} null effect is due not to what was manipulated but due to the subtlety with which the gender information was conveyed in each trial. In contrast to Exp.~1 and \citeposs{mahler2020} experiment, where the relevant information (e.g., that Julian is Cuban or that the speaker is at the College Republican club meeting) was explicitly stated, the gender of the relevant individual in \citeposs{lorson2018} experiment was conveyed by using an ``unambiguously female or unambiguously male name'' (p.37).}

Second, while \citealt{mahler2020} observed an influence of prior probability of the projection of the contents of the complements of two classes of predicates (so-called factive vs.\ non-factive predicates), Exp.~1 observed such an influence for the contents of the complements of 20 clause-embedding predicates. Thus, the result of Exp.~1 support the assumption that the effect of prior probability on projection is more general than was suggested in \citealt{mahler2020}. In fact, the results of Exp.~1 motivate the hypothesis that prior probability influences projection across the set of English clause-embedding predicates. Finally, prior probability and projection were measured in a within-participant design in Exp.~1, in contrast to \citeposs{mahler2020} experiment, which only measured projection.  Exp.~1 thus showed that the projection of content was influenced not only by its average prior probability but also by the prior probability that it was assigned by individual interpreters. This result suggests that by-participant variability in projection experiments (see, e.g., \citealt{tbd-variability,tonhauser-degen-factive}) may be due to participants assigning different prior probabilities to the contents under investigation. It is possible, however, that the within-participant design resulted in participants' responses on either block influencing their responses on the other block. To mitigate against this possibility, we conducted Exps.~2, where prior probability and projection ratings were collected from different populations.  

\section{Experiments 2}\label{s3}

The 300 participants in Exp.~2b (ages: 21-72, median: 36; 145 female, 154 male, 1 undeclared) were paid 85 cents.\footnote{28 participants took both experiments. Given that the experiments were run two weeks apart (Exp.~2a on November 13, 2017 and Exp.~2b on November 28, 2017, it is unlikely that these 28 participants' prior ratings influenced their projection ratings.}

\paragraph{Materials and procedures} The 40 target stimuli of Exp.~2a were identical to those of the prior block of Exp.~1. Each participants saw the two control stimuli in (\ref{control}), which were included to assess attention to the task. We expected high prior probability ratings for (\ref{control}a) and low ones for (\ref{control}b). 

\begin{exe}
\ex\label{control2}
\begin{xlist}
\ex {\bf Fact:} Barry lives in Germany. \\ How likely is it that Barry lives in Europe?
\ex {\bf Fact:} Tammy is a rabbit. \\ How likely is it that Tammy speaks Italian and Greek?
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
The materials of Exp.~2b were identical to those of the projection block of Exp.~1. Trial order in both experiments was random. The procedures of Exps.~2a and 2b were identical to those of the prior and projection blocks of Exp.~1, respectively.

\paragraph{Data exclusion} We excluded data based on the criteria given in Supplement \ref{a-exclusion}, leaving data from 75 participants to be analyzed in Exp.~2a (ages 21-75; median: 35; 34 female, 41 male) and of 266 participants in Exp.~2b (ages 21-72; median: 36; 129 female, 136 male, 1 undeclared).

\subsection{Results and discussion}

Exps.~2 replicated the critical result of Exp.~1, that the prior probability of content influences the projection of that content.\footnote{Exps.~2 also replicated other results of Exp.~1. First, Exp.~2a replicated the manipulation of the prior probability of the 20 contents: The Spearman rank correlation of the results of Exp~2a and the prior block of Exp.~1 was high, at .977; see Supplement \ref{a-exp2} for visualizations. Exp.~2b replicated \citepos{tonhauser-degen-factive} result that there is by-predicate variation in the projection of the content of the complement; see Supplement \ref{a-comparison}.} \jt{report models predicting a) projection mean Exp 2b from prior mean Exp 2b, b) projection mean Exp 1 from prior mean Exp 2b, and c) projection mean Exp 2b from prior mean Exp 1). USE COHENS D?} These results suggest that the result of Exp.~1 is not an artifact of the within-participant design of Exp.~1.

\section{Concluding remarks}\label{s4}

This paper provided empirical support for \citetpos{stevens-etal2017} and \citetpos{tbd-variability} hypothesis that prior probability influences projection, that is, that interpreters' beliefs about utterance content influence their inferences about speaker commitment to that content. A pressing question for future research is how prior probabilities interact with other factors that have been shown to influence projection, such as at-issueness (e.g., \citealt{tbd-variability}) and prosody (e.g., \citealt{cummins-rohde2015,tonhauser-salt26,djaerv-bacovcin-salt27,tonhauser-etal-sub23,mahler-etal2020}). On the theoretical side, our result motivates the development of projection analyses that predict the influence of prior probability on the projection of the content of English clause-embedding predicates. Analyses currently on the market do not predict the results of our experiments  because they are limited to a sub-class of clause-embedding predicates, like factive ones (e.g., \citealt{heim83,vds92,abrusan2011,abrusan2016,romoli2015,best-question}).

In the target stimuli of the projection block of Exp.~1, eventive predicates, like {\em discover} and {\em hear}, were realized in the past tense and stative predicates, like {\em know} and {\em be annoyed}, were realized in the present tense. The direct object of {\em inform} was realized by the proper name {\em Sam}. The subject of the clause-embedding predicate and the speaker of the target stimuli were realized by a proper name. 

The following list gives the six clauses that were used in the control and filler stimuli of Exp.~1, with their facts. In the prior block, these six clauses were embedded under {\em How likely is it that\ldots?}. The projection block featured polar questions variants of the clauses.

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=3ex,itemsep=-2pt]
\ex Zack is coming to the meeting tomorrow. Fact: Zack is a member of the golf club. 

\ex Mary's aunt is sick. Fact: Mary visited her aunt on Sunday. 

\ex Todd played football in high school. Fact: Todd goes to the gym 3 times a week. 

\ex Vanessa is good at math. Fact: Vanessa won a prize at school. 

\ex Madison had a baby. Fact: Trish sent Madison a card. 

\ex Hendrick's car was expensive. Fact: Hendrick just bought a car. 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Data exclusion}\label{a-exclusion}

Table \ref{f-exclusion} presents how many participants' data were excluded from the analyses based on the exclusion criteria. The first column records the experiment, the second (`recruited') how many participants were recruited, and the final column (`remaining') how many participants' data entered the analysis. The `Exclusion criteria' columns show how many participants' data were excluded based on the two exclusion criteria: 

\begin{itemize}[topsep = -1ex,itemsep=-2pt]

%\item `multiple': Due to an experimental glitch, some participants participated in Exps.~1b, 2b or 3b more than once. Of these participants, we only analyzed the data from the first time they participated.

\item `language': Participants' data were excluded if they did not self-identify as native speakers of American English.

\item `controls': In Exps.~1 and 2b, participants' data were excluded if their response mean on the 6 control items was more than 2 sd above the group mean. In Exp.~2a, participants' data were excluded if their response mean was more than 2 sd below the group mean of the control in (\ref{control}a) or more than 2 sd above the group mean of the control in (\ref{control}b).

%\item `variance': Participants' data were excluded if they always selected roughly the same point on the response scale, that is, if the variance of their response distribution was more than 2 sd below the group mean variance. \jt{did we do variance or not? if not, why not?}

\end{itemize}

% exp 1 (prior, projection)
%Prior to analysis, the data from 3 participants who did not self-identify as native speakers of American English were excluded. To assess whether the remaining 297 participants attended to the task, we inspected their responses to the control stimuli. We excluded the data from 11 participants whose response means were more than 2 standard deviations above the group mean. The data from 286 participants (ages 18-82; median: 35.5; 116 female, 186 male, 1 other, 1 undeclared) were analyzed.

% exp 2a (prior):
%Prior to analysis, the data from 8 participants who did not self-identify as native speakers of American English were excluded. To assess whether the remaining 87 participants attended to the task, we inspected their responses to the 2 control stimuli. The response means of 12 participants were more than 2 standard deviations below the group mean of the control in (\ref{control}a) or more than 2 standard deviations above the group mean of the control in (\ref{control}b). We excluded the data from these participants, leaving data from 75 participants (ages 21-75; median: 35; 34 female, 41 male).

% exp 2b (projection):
%Prior to analysis, the data from 23 participants who did not self-identify as native speakers of American English were excluded. To assess whether the remaining 277 participants attended to the task, we inspected their responses to the 6 control stimuli. There were 11 participants whose response means were more than 2 standard deviations above the group mean. We excluded the data from these participants, too, leaving data from 266 participants (ages 21-72; median: 36; 129 female, 136 male, 1 undeclared).

\section{Model details for Experiments 1 and 2}\label{modeldetails}

This supplement provides details on the data analysis conducted for Exps.~1, 2, and 3. We first motivate the use of Beta regression rather than linear regression in Exps.~1a, 2a, and 3a (section \ref{a-motivation}) and then provide a brief primer on how to interpret Bayesian mixed effects Beta regression models (section \ref{a-primer}). We then report the model outputs for Exps.~1, 2, and 3 (section \ref{a-mo}).

\subsection{Motivation for using Bayesian mixed effects Beta regression}\label{a-motivation}

There are three separate pieces to motivate: the use of \emph{mixed effects}, the use of a \emph{Bayesian} rather than \emph{frequentist} models, and the use of \emph{Beta regression} rather than \emph{linear regression}. 

\textbf{Using mixed effects} refers to the practice of modeling the outcome variable, here slider ratings or proportions of `yes' ratings, as a function of not just fixed effects of interest (i.e., predicate) but also as the result of possible random variability that is not of theoretical interest (e.g., random by-participant or by-item variability). This is standard practice in psycholinguistic studies and allows the researcher to trust that any observed effects of theoretical interest are true average effects rather than the result of idiosyncratic behavior (e.g., of participants or items). This is also the motivation for using mixed effects in Exps.~1b, 2b, and 3b.

\textbf{Using Bayesian models} rather than frequentist models is increasingly becoming the norm in psycholinguistic studies as computational power has increased and running Bayesian models has become more accessible with the introduction of R packages such as \verb|brms| \citep{buerkner2017}. The presence of an effect in frequentist models is evaluated by checking whether the {\em p-}value is smaller than $.05$, where the {\em p-}value is defined as the probability of obtaining data that is as skewed or more skewed than the observed data if the null-hypothesis was true, i.e., if the hypothesized effect was absent. Parameter estimates in frequentist models are obtained via maximum-likelihood techniques, i.e., by estimating the parameter values that maximize the probability of observing the data. Bayesian models, by contrast, return a full posterior distribution over parameter values that take into account not just the probability of the data under the parameter values, but also the prior probability of parameter values. In order to evaluate the evidence for an effect of a predictor of interest, one can report 95\% credible intervals and the posterior probability $P(\beta < 0)$ or $P(\beta > 0)$ that the predictor coefficient $\beta$ is either lower or greater than zero, depending on the direction of the expected effect. A 95\% credible interval (CI) demarcates the range of values that comprise 95\% of probability mass of the posterior beliefs such that no value inside the CI has a lower probability than any point outside it \citep{Jaynes1976, Morey2016}. There is substantial evidence for an effect if zero is (by a reasonably clear margin) not included in the 95\% CI and $P(\beta > 0)$ or $P(\beta < 0)$ is close to zero or one. Posterior probabilities indicate the probability that the parameter has a certain value, given the data and model -- these probabilities are thus \emph{not} frequentist {\em p-}values. In order to present statistics as close to widely used frequentist practices, and following \citealt{Nicenboim2016}, we defined an inferential criterion that seems familiar (95\%), but the strength of evidence should not be taken as having clear cut-off points (such as in a null-hypothesis significance testing framework).

\textbf{Using Beta regression} rather than linear regression was motivated by the violation of two of the  assumptions of linear regression: first, that residuals be normally distributed (where ``residuals'' refers to the residual error for each data point after fitting the model), and second, that the error term exhibit homoscedasticity (that it be roughly the same across different conditions). Slider ratings data has the property of being bounded by its endpoints (which we code as 0 and 1, respectively). This often leads to ``bunching'' behavior at the endpoints (see Figure \ref{fig:bunch} for the distribution of raw ratings in Exps.~1a, 2a, and 3a). 


\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{subfigure}{.33\textwidth}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../../results/9-prior-projection/graphs/bunching-projection}
\caption{Exp.~1 certainty ratings.}
\label{fig:exp1araw}
\end{subfigure}
\begin{subfigure}{.33\textwidth}

\label{fig:exp3araw}
\end{subfigure}
\caption{Histograms of raw slider ratings in Exps.~1 and 2.}
\label{fig:bunch}
\end{figure}

This ``bunching'' behavior, in turn, can lead to the violation of both of the above assumptions of linear regression. 
Intuitively, these assumptions are violated because conditions that elicit ratings closer to endpoints necessarily have a compressed variance; consequently, a condition's mean and its variance are not independent. Beta regression is useful here because it allows for modeling an arbitrarily distributed outcome variable in the $[$0,1$]$ interval. The Beta distribution is characterized by two parameters, one capturing the mean $\mu$ of the distribution and one capturing its precision $\phi$, a measure of dispersion. The greater the precision, the more concentrated the values are around the mean, i.e., the lower the variance of the distribution.  We follow \citet{smithson2006} in modeling $\mu$ and $\phi$ separately for each predictor. That is, we allow each predictor to affect both the mean and the precision of the outcome variable's distribution. 

\subsection{Coding choices and interpreting model output}\label{a-primer}

The outcome variable in Exps.~1a, 2a and 3a (slider ratings) contained the values 0 and 1, which Beta regression is undefined for. We therefore applied a common transformation to ratings before the main analysis that rescales values $y$ to fall in the open unit interval (0,1)  \citep{smithson2006}. First, we apply $y' = (y-a)/(b-a)$, where $b$ is the highest possible slider rating and $a$ is the smallest possible slider rating. The range is then compressed to not include 0 and 1 by applying $y'' = [y'(N-1) + 1/2]/N$, where $N$ is the total number of observations.

The mean parameter $\mu$ is modeled via a logit link function (default for Beta regression in \verb|brms|), though other links that squeeze $\mu$ into the $[$0,1$]$ interval are possible. The dispersion parameter $\phi$ is modeled via a log link, which ensures that values of $\phi$ are strictly positive, which is necessary because a variance cannot be negative. 

We allowed both $\mu$ and $\phi$ to vary as a function of predicate, with reference level set to main clause control in Exp.~1a, entailing control in Exp.~2a and contradictory control in Exp.~3a. We also allowed random intercept adjustments to each parameter by participant and by item, where item was defined as a unique combination of a predicate and a complement clause. Four chains converged after 2000 iterations each (warmup = 1000, \(\hat{R}=1\) for all estimated parameters) with a target acceptance rate of .95 and a maximum treedepth of 15.

\subsection{Model outputs for Experiments 1, 2 and 3}\label{a-mo}

The three tables in this section show the model outputs for Exps.~1, 2 and 3, respectively: Table \ref{tab:exp1modelresults} for Exps.~1a and 1b, Table \ref{tab:exp2modelresults} for Exps.~2a and 2b, and Table \ref{tab:exp3modelresults} for Exps.~3a and 3b. Each table shows maximum a posteriori (MAP) model estimates for projection ratings from the Beta regression model (left and middle column, mean $\mu$ and precision $\phi$) and the logistic regression model (right column, $\beta$)  with 95\% credible intervals.

\section{Projection results (Exp.~2b) and comparisons}\label{a-comparison}

Figure \ref{f-projection-mean-2b} shows that the mean certainty ratings of Exp.~2b were higher for contents presented with the higher probability facts than for contents presented with the lower probability fact. This result suggests that prior probability influences projection.

\label{f-projection-mean-2b}
\end{figure}

Comparisons of the projection results of Exp.~1, Exp.~2b, and \citepos{tonhauser-degen-factive} Exp.~1a (abbreviated `TD Exp.~1a') in Figure \ref{f-projection-comparisons} reveal striking similarities. The Spearman rank correlations were XX (Exp.~1 vs.\ TD Exp.~1a), XX (Exp.~2b vs.\ TD Exp.~1a) and XX (Exp.~1 vs.\ Exp.~2b).

\section{Prior probability results (Exp.~2a) and comparisons}\label{a-exp2}

The manipulation of the prior probability of the 20 contents was successful. Figure \ref{f-prior-2a} plots the mean prior probabilities of the 20 contents by fact (participants' ratings are given as light dots). The mean prior probability rating for each content was higher when the content was presented with the higher probability fact than when it was presented with the lower probability fact.
