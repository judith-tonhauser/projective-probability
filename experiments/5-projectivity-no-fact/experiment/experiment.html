<p class="block-text" id="instruct-text">We ask you: Given what Bill says, is he certain that Patty lives in Canada? </p>

<p class="block-text" id="instruct-text">You give your response on a sliding scale from 'no' to 'yes'.</p> 

<p class="block-text" id="instruct-text">There are a total of 26 items. The task will take about 6 minutes and you will be paid 75 cents.</p>

<p class="block-text" id="instruct-text">We have included some items for which we already know the answer. If you are paying attention, you are sure to get those right! At the end of the task, we will ask you four short questions about you and your language use. You will be paid no matter what you answer there, so please answer truthfully.</p>

Thank you!

    <p id="legal">By clicking on the button above you agree to participate in this experiment, which is conducted by a researcher at The Ohio State University. The goal of this research is to understand how English sentences are interpreted and, if you participate in the experiment, you will be asked, as explained above, to provide judgments about English sentences. You may withdraw from this experiment at any time or skip any questions without penalty or loss of benefits, including loss or reduction of payment. If you do withdraw from the study before the end, please contact the researchers for information on how to collect payment (tonhauser dot 1 at osu dot edu). The data collected will be anonymous and confidential.  If you have any questions, you may contact the requester through Amazonâ€™s Mechanical Turk platform, or directly at tonhauser dot 1 at osu dot edu. For questions about your rights as a participant in this study or to discuss other study-related concerns or complaints with someone who is not part of the research team, you may contact Ms. Sandra Meadows in the Ohio State University Office of Responsible Research Practices at 1-800-678-6251.</p>

    <h4>Instructions</h4>
<p class="block-text">Imagine you are at a party. You walk into the kitchen and overhear a short conversation, like this one: 

<br>
<br><b>Carol:</b> <i>Luke was sensible to buy a Jeep. </i>
<br><b>Bill:</b> <i>Are you sure? </i>
<br><b>Carol:</b> <i>Yes, I am sure that Luke bought a Jeep.</i>

<br> <br> Your task is to evaluate whether Carol answered Bill's question. You'll give your answers on a simple sliding scale from 'no' to 'yes'.

<br> <br> There are a total of 20 conversations we ask you to judge. 

<p class="block-text"> <b> Payment:</b> You will be paid 30 cents to
participate in this experiment, which will take about 3 minutes to
complete. <br> </p>

<p class="block-text"> <b>To make sure you are paying attention, we have included some questions for which we know the right answer. If you read the questions carefully, you will definitely get those right.<br></b></p>
 -->
   
<!--
<p class="block-text">
<b> Survey:</b> At the end of the experiment, we'll ask you three short questions about you and your language background. You will be paid no matter what answers you give in this survey (so please answer truthfully).
