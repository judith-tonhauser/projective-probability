This directory contains 9 experiments, 8 of which are described in the papers Degen & Tonhauser (2021), "Prior beliefs modulate projection" and Degen & Tonhauser (2022), "Are there factive predicates? An empirical investigation." 


# Degen & Tonhauser (2021), "Prior beliefs modulate projection."

## Exp. 1

* Location: `9-prior-projection`
* Prior probability and certainty ratings for contents, given a fact. 
* Prior ratings task (sliding scale): *"Fact: Julian is German. How likely is it that Julian dances salsa?"*
* Certainty ratings task (sliding scale): *"Fact (which Sue knows): Bill is Cuban. Sue asks: Does Jane know that Bill dances salsa?" Task: "Is Sue certain that Bill dances salsa?"*

## Exp. 2a

* Location: `1-prior`
* Prior probability ratings for contents, given a fact. 
* Task (sliding scale): *"Fact: Julian is German. How likely is it that Julian dances salsa?"*

## Exp. 2b
* Location: `3-projectivity`
* Certainty ratings for contents, given a fact. 
* Task (sliding scale): *"Fact (which Sue knows): Bill is Cuban. Sue asks: Does Jane know that Bill dances salsa?"; task: "Is Sue certain that Bill dances salsa?"*


# Degen & Tonhauser (2022), "Are there factive predicates? An empirical investigation."

## Exp. 1a

* Location: `5-projectivity-no-fact`
* Measurement: certainty ratings 
* Measurement type: continuous slider ratings
* Task: *"Sue asks: Does Jane know that Bill dances salsa?"; Task: "Is Sue certain that Bill dances salsa?"*

## Exp. 1b

* Location: `8-projectivity-no-fact-binary`
* Measurement: certainty ratings 
* Measurement type: binary choice
* Task: *"Sue asks: Does Jane know that Bill dances salsa?"; Task: "Is Sue certain that Bill dances salsa?"*

## Exp. 2a

* Location: `4-veridicality3`
* Measurement: inference strength ratings 
* Measurement type: continuous slider ratings
* Task: *"What is true: Jane knows that Bill dances salsa."; Task: "Does it follow that Bill dances salsa?"*

## Exp. 2b

* Location: `7-veridicality3-binary`
* Measurement: inference strength ratings 
* Measurement type: binary choice
* Task: *"What is true: Jane knows that Bill dances salsa."; Task: "Does it follow that Bill dances salsa?"*


## Exp. 3a

* Location: `2-veridicality2`
* Measurement: contradictoriness ratings 
* Measurement type: continuous slider ratings
* Task: *"Sue: Jane knows that Bill dances salsa, but he doesn't"; Task: "Is Sue's utterance contradictory?"*

## Exp. 3b

* Location: `6-veridicality2-binary`
* Measurement: contradictoriness ratings 
* Measurement type: binary choice
* Task: *"Sue: Jane knows that Bill dances salsa, but he doesn't"; Task: "Is Sue's utterance contradictory?"*

# Additional studies

`2-veridicality` -- not reported anywhere: contradictoriness ratings (stimulus: "Sue: Jane knows that Bill dances salsa, but I know that he doesn't"; task: "Is Sue's utterance contradictory?"). We re-ran this experiment with a slightly different stimulus design (omitting the "I know that" part) after realizing that the stimulus assumes that the CC of "know" is entailed and that the diagnostic works just as well in the simplified way.
