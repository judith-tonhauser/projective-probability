This readme gives details on the experiments that the analyses in this results folder pertain to.

There are 10 experiments in this folder. They are described below. 

The folder "compare-diagnostics-and-response-tasks" compares the results of the (slider rating) experiments 2-veridicality2, 4-veridicality3, and 5-projectivity-no-fact, to the results of the (binary ratings) experiments 6-veridicality2-binary, 7-veridicality3-binary, and 8-projectivity-no-fact-binary, respectively. These comparisons are reported in Tonhauser & Degen "Are there factive predicates? An empirical investigation" (factives-paper.pdf).



## slider ratings
1-prior -- Exp. 2a in prior paper: prior probability ratings given a fact (stimulus: "Fact: Julian is German. How likely is it that Julian dances salsa?")

2-veridicality -- not reported anywhere: contradictoriness ratings (stimulus: "Sue: Jane knows that Bill dances salsa, but I know that he doesn't"; task: "Is Sue's utterance contradictory?"). We re-ran this experiment with a slightly different stimulus design (omitting the "I know that" part) after realizing that the stimulus assumes that the CC of "know" is entailed and that the diagnostic works just as well in the simplified way.

2-veridicality2 -- Exp. 3a in factives paper: contradictoriness ratings (stimulus: "Sue: Jane knows that Bill dances salsa, but he doesn't"; task: "Is Sue's utterance contradictory?")

3-projectivity -- Exp. 2b in prior paper: certainty ratings with Fact info (stimulus: "Fact (which Sue knows): Bill is Cuban. Sue asks: Does Jane know that Bill dances salsa?"; task: "Is Sue certain that Bill dances salsa?")

4-veridicality3 -- Exp. 2a in factives paper: inference strength ratings (stimulus: "What is true: Jane knows that Bill dances salsa."; task: "Does it follow that Bill dances salsa?")

5-projectivity-no-fact -- Exp. 1a in factives paper: certainty ratings (stimulus: "Sue asks: Does Jane know that Bill dances salsa?"; task: "Is Sue certain that Bill dances salsa?"). We ran this after realizing that before we can write the prior paper, we need to get clarity on the notion of factivity. Thus, the "factives-paper" was written before the "prior-paper".

9-prior-projection -- Exp. 1 in prior paper: prior probability and certainty ratings for contents given a fact. Prior ratings as in 1-prior; certainty ratings as in 3-projectivity, but a within-participant design. This was originally "exp4" in the "attitude_preds_projection" repo, but we ran this for the prior paper, which lives in this repo.


## binary ratings
6-veridicality2-binary -- Exp. 3b in factives paper: contradictoriness ratings (stimulus: "Sue: Jane knows that Bill dances salsa, but he doesn't"; task: "Is Sue's utterance contradictory?")

7-veridicality3-binary -- Exp. 2b in factives paper: inference strength ratings (stimulus: "What is true: Jane knows that Bill dances salsa."; task: "Does it follow that Bill dances salsa?")

8-projectivity-no-fact-binary -- Exp. 1b in factives paper: certainty ratings (stimulus: "Sue asks: Does Jane know that Bill dances salsa?"; task: "Is Sue certain that Bill dances salsa?")
