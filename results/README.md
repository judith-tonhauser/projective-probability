This folder contains the data and analyses of 9 experiments, described below.

The folder "compare-diagnostics-and-response-tasks" compares the results of the (slider rating) experiments 2-veridicality2, 4-veridicality3, and 5-projectivity-no-fact, to the results of the (binary ratings) experiments 6-veridicality2-binary, 7-veridicality3-binary, and 8-projectivity-no-fact-binary, respectively. These comparisons are reported in Degen & Tonhauser (2022), "Are there factive predicates? An empirical investigation."

The folder "projection-comparisons" compares the results of the projection experiments 3-projectivity, 5-projectivity-no-fact, and 9-prior-projection. These comparisons are reported in Degen & Tonhauser (2021), "Prior beliefs modulate projection."

## Degen & Tonhauser (2021), "Prior beliefs modulate projection."

### Exp. 1

* Location: `9-prior-projection`
* Prior probability and certainty ratings for contents, given a fact. 
* Prior ratings task (sliding scale): *"Fact: Julian is German. How likely is it that Julian dances salsa?"*
* Certainty ratings task (sliding scale): *"Fact (which Sue knows): Bill is Cuban. Sue asks: Does Jane know that Bill dances salsa?" Task: "Is Sue certain that Bill dances salsa?"*

### Exp. 2a

* Location: `1-prior`
* Prior probability ratings for contents, given a fact. 
* Task (sliding scale): *"Fact: Julian is German. How likely is it that Julian dances salsa?"*

### Exp. 2b
* Location: `3-projectivity`
* Certainty ratings for contents, given a fact. 
* Task (sliding scale): *"Fact (which Sue knows): Bill is Cuban. Sue asks: Does Jane know that Bill dances salsa?"; task: "Is Sue certain that Bill dances salsa?"*

### slider ratings (reported in "factives-paper" and "prior-paper")

2-veridicality -- not reported anywhere: contradictoriness ratings (stimulus: "Sue: Jane knows that Bill dances salsa, but I know that he doesn't"; task: "Is Sue's utterance contradictory?"). We re-ran this experiment with a slightly different stimulus design (omitting the "I know that" part) after realizing that the stimulus assumes that the CC of "know" is entailed and that the diagnostic works just as well in the simplified way.

2-veridicality2 -- Exp. 3a in factives paper: contradictoriness ratings (stimulus: "Sue: Jane knows that Bill dances salsa, but he doesn't"; task: "Is Sue's utterance contradictory?")


4-veridicality3 -- Exp. 2a in factives paper: inference strength ratings (stimulus: "What is true: Jane knows that Bill dances salsa."; task: "Does it follow that Bill dances salsa?")

5-projectivity-no-fact -- Exp. 1a in factives paper: certainty ratings (stimulus: "Sue asks: Does Jane know that Bill dances salsa?"; task: "Is Sue certain that Bill dances salsa?"). We ran this after realizing that before we can write the prior paper, we need to get clarity on the notion of factivity. Thus, the "factives-paper" was written before the "prior-paper".




## binary ratings (reported in "factives-paper")
6-veridicality2-binary -- Exp. 3b in factives paper: contradictoriness ratings (stimulus: "Sue: Jane knows that Bill dances salsa, but he doesn't"; task: "Is Sue's utterance contradictory?")

7-veridicality3-binary -- Exp. 2b in factives paper: inference strength ratings (stimulus: "What is true: Jane knows that Bill dances salsa."; task: "Does it follow that Bill dances salsa?")

8-projectivity-no-fact-binary -- Exp. 1b in factives paper: certainty ratings (stimulus: "Sue asks: Does Jane know that Bill dances salsa?"; task: "Is Sue certain that Bill dances salsa?")
