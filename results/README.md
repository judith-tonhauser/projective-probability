This readme gives details on the experiments that the analyses in this results folder pertain to.

JD, you need to fit models for the two sets of three experiments under "slider ratings" and "binary ratings".

## slider ratings
2-veridicality2: contradictoriness ratings (stimulus: "Sue: Jane knows that Bill dances salsa, but he doesn't"; task: "Is Sue's utterance contradictory?")

4-veridicality3: inference strength ratings (stimulus: "What is true: Jane knows that Bill dances salsa."; task: "Does it follow that Bill dances salsa?")

5-projectivity-no-fact: certainty ratings (stimulus: "Sue asks: Does Jane know that Bill dances salsa?"; task: "Is Sue certain that Bill dances salsa?")


## binary ratings
6-veridicality2-binary: contradictoriness ratings (stimulus: "Sue: Jane knows that Bill dances salsa, but he doesn't"; task: "Is Sue's utterance contradictory?")

7-veridicality3-binary: inference strength ratings (stimulus: "What is true: Jane knows that Bill dances salsa."; task: "Does it follow that Bill dances salsa?")

8-projectivity-no-fact-binary: certainty ratings (stimulus: "Sue asks: Does Jane know that Bill dances salsa?"; task: "Is Sue certain that Bill dances salsa?")

## other experiment results in this folder
1-prior: slider ratings on prior probability (stimulus: "Fact: Bill is Cuban."; task: "How likely is it that Bill dances salsa?")

2-veridicality: slider ratings of contradictoriness with "I know" in continuation (stimulus: "Sue: Jane knows that Bill dances salsa, but I know that he doesn't"; task: "Is Sue's utterance contradictory?")

3-projectivity: certainty ratings with Fact info (stimulus: "Fact (which Sue knows): Bill is Cuban. Sue asks: Does Jane know that Bill dances salsa?"; task: "Is Sue certain that Bill dances salsa?")
