This readme gives details on relevant aspects of the experiments that these analyses pertain.

Comment for JD: you need to fit models to two sets of experiments, namely those under "slider ratings" and those under "binary ratings"

1-prior: collected slider ratings on "how likely is it that p?" (fully analyzed)

2-veridicality: slider ratings of contradictoriness of sentences with "...but I know that not p"

## slider ratings
2-veridicality2: ratings of contradictoriness (stimulus: "S-CC, but not CC"; task: "Is Bill's utterance contradictory?")
3-projectivity: certainty ratings (stimulus: "S-CC?"; task: "Is Bill certain that CC?")
4-veridicality3: ratings of inference strength (stimulus: "What is true: S-CC."; task: "Does it follow that CC?")

## binary ratings
