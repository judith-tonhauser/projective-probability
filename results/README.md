This readme gives details on the experiments that the analyses in this results folder pertain to.

There are 10 experiments in this folder. They are described below. 

The folder "compare-diagnostics-and-response-tasks" compares the results of the (slider rating) experiments 2-veridicality2, 4-veridicality3, and 5-projectivity-no-fact, to the results of the (binary ratings) experiments 6-veridicality2-binary, 7-veridicality3-binary, and 8-projectivity-no-fact-binary, respectively. These comparisons are reported in Tonhauser & Degen "Are there factive predicates? An empirical investigation" (factives-paper.pdf).



## slider ratings
2-veridicality2 -- Exp. 3a: contradictoriness ratings (stimulus: "Sue: Jane knows that Bill dances salsa, but he doesn't"; task: "Is Sue's utterance contradictory?")

4-veridicality3 -- Exp. 2a: inference strength ratings (stimulus: "What is true: Jane knows that Bill dances salsa."; task: "Does it follow that Bill dances salsa?")

5-projectivity-no-fact -- Exp. 1a: certainty ratings (stimulus: "Sue asks: Does Jane know that Bill dances salsa?"; task: "Is Sue certain that Bill dances salsa?")


## binary ratings
6-veridicality2-binary -- Exp. 3b: contradictoriness ratings (stimulus: "Sue: Jane knows that Bill dances salsa, but he doesn't"; task: "Is Sue's utterance contradictory?")

7-veridicality3-binary -- Exp. 2b: inference strength ratings (stimulus: "What is true: Jane knows that Bill dances salsa."; task: "Does it follow that Bill dances salsa?")

8-projectivity-no-fact-binary -- Exp. 1b: certainty ratings (stimulus: "Sue asks: Does Jane know that Bill dances salsa?"; task: "Is Sue certain that Bill dances salsa?")

## other experiment results in this folder
1-prior: slider ratings on prior probability (stimulus: "Fact: Bill is Cuban."; task: "How likely is it that Bill dances salsa?")

2-veridicality: slider ratings of contradictoriness with "I know" in continuation (stimulus: "Sue: Jane knows that Bill dances salsa, but I know that he doesn't"; task: "Is Sue's utterance contradictory?")

3-projectivity: certainty ratings with Fact info (stimulus: "Fact (which Sue knows): Bill is Cuban. Sue asks: Does Jane know that Bill dances salsa?"; task: "Is Sue certain that Bill dances salsa?")
