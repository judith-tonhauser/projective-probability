This readme gives details on relevant aspects of the experiments that these analyses pertain.

Comment for JD: you need to fit models for the two sets of three experiments under "slider ratings" and "binary ratings".

## slider ratings
2-veridicality2: ratings of contradictoriness (stimulus: "Sue: Jane knows that Bill dances salsa, but he doesn't"; task: "Is Sue's utterance contradictory?")

4-veridicality3: ratings of inference strength (stimulus: "What is true: Jane knows that Bill dances salsa."; task: "Does it follow that Bill dances salsa?")

5-projectivity-no-fact: certainty ratings (stimulus: "Sue asks: Does Jane know that Bill dances salsa?"; task: "Is Sue certain that Bill dances salsa?")


## binary ratings
2-veridicality2: ratings of contradictoriness (stimulus: "Sue: Jane knows that Bill dances salsa, but he doesn't"; task: "Is Sue's utterance contradictory?")


4-veridicality3: ratings of inference strength (stimulus: "What is true: Jane knows that Bill dances salsa."; task: "Does it follow that Bill dances salsa?")


## other experiment results in this folder
1-prior: collected slider ratings on "how likely is it that p?" (fully analyzed)

2-veridicality: slider ratings of contradictoriness of sentences with "...but I know that not p"

3-projectivity: certainty ratings (stimulus: "Fact (which Sue knows): Bill is Cuban. Sue asks: Does Jane know that Bill dances salsa?"; task: "Is Sue certain that Bill dances salsa?")
