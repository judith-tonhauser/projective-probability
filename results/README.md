README for the results folder

This readme gives details on relevant aspects of the experiments that these analyses pertain.

Comment for JD: you need to fit models to two sets of experiments, namely those under "slider ratings" and those under "binary ratings"

1-prior: collected slider ratings on "how likely is it that p?" (fully analyzed)
2-veridicality: slider ratings of contradictoriness of sentences with "...but I know that not p"

# slider ratings
2-veridicality2: slider ratings of contradictoriness
